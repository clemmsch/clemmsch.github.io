<h1>An Argument Against Simplicity</h1>
<p>Each who has spent time in the general community of open-source software has, presumably, encountered numerous people with - I dare to say - extremist opinions. Whether they believe that any technological invention after C and Unix was a mistake (Presumably, they share their opinion on HackerNews using Firefox, written in C++) or they believe that anything older than NODE-JS-PACKAGE#5534732 has served us for long enough and may from now on be considered as obsolete (They presumably share their opinion using Windows, written in C).</p>
